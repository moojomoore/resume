          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          In my time as Director of Technology, I have conceptualized and completed several large-scale projects. This includes communication with many different parties, project management, and significant attention to detail. In the past year, I was able to successfully transition staff and students to distance learning and with the new school year, seamlessly communicate with and support both in-person and distance learners.
